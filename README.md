# LIBMX Description
The goal was to create a helper library of useful functions to make working with the code even easier.

Functions that could be used to create a library: `malloc, malloc_size/malloc_usable_size, free, open,read, write, close, exit`. 

Library is compiled with `clang -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic`.

To compile library use function `make`.

```mx_printchar``` - Prints single character on the standard output.

```mx_printstr``` - Prints string of characters on the standard output.

```mx_print_strarr``` - Print array of strings.

```mx_printint``` - Function that prints integer values on the standard output.

```mx_pow``` - Function that computes ```n``` raised to the power of zero or positive integer ```pow``` .

```mx_sqrt``` - Function that computes the non-negative square root of ```x``` . Function must compute square root in less than 2 seconds.

```mx_nbr_to_hex``` - Function that converts an unsigned long number into a hexadecimal.

```mx_hex_to_nbr``` - Function that converts a hexadecimal string into an unsigned long number.

```mx_itoa``` - Function that takes an integer and converts it to a string.

```mx_print_unicode``` - Prints ASCII and multibyte characters on standard output.

```mx_foreach``` - Function applies the function ```f``` for each element of the array ```arr``` of the given size.

```mx_binary_search``` - Function that searches string ```s``` in array ```arr``` with the given size. Uses the binary search algorithm assuming that input array has already been sorted in lexicographical order.

```mx_bubble_sort``` - Function that sorts an array of strings in place in exicographical order using bubble sort algorithm.

```mx_quicksort``` - Function that sorts an array of strings by their length in ascending order using algorithm of quick sort. Pick middle element of the array as pivot. You must not check if ```left``` and ```right``` are correct.


## [Strings pack](strings_pack)

```mx_strlen``` - Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```strlen``` .

```mx_arrlen``` - Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```mx_arrlen``` .

```mx_swap_char``` - Function which will swap the characters of the string using pointers. Do nothing if ```s1``` or ```s2``` does not exist.

```mx_str_reverse``` - Function which reverses string using pointers. Do nothing if string does not exist.

```mx_strdel``` - Function that takes a pointer to string, then frees the string memory with ```free``` and sets string to ```NULL``` .

```mx_del_strarr``` - Function that takes pointer to a NULL-terminated array of strings, deletes content of array, frees array memory with ```free``` and sets pointer to ```NULL``` .

```mx_get_char_index``` - Function that finds index of the first occurrence of character ```c``` in a string str. String is a sequence of characters excluding the trailing ``` \0 ``` character.

```mx_strdup``` - Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```strdup``` .

```mx_strndup``` - Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```strndup``` .

```mx_get_substr_index``` - Function that finds a index of substring.

```mx_count_substr``` - Function that counts number of occurrences of substring in a string.

```mx_count_words``` - Function which count words in the string. Word is a sequence of characters separated by delimiter.

```mx_strnew``` - Function that: allocates memory for a string of a specific ```size``` and one additional byte for terminating ``` '\0' ```, initializes each character with 
``` '\0' ```, string of a specific size and terminated by ``` '\0' ```, ```NULL``` if the creation fails.

```mx_strtrim ``` - Function which creates new string without whitespace characters at the beginning and the end of the string and frees all unused memory with ```free ```.

```mx_del_extra_spaces ``` - Function that creates new string without whitespace characters in the beginning and at the end of a string. It puts in the new string exactly one space character between words and frees all unused memory. Word is a sequence of characters separated by whitespaces.

```mx_strsplit ``` - Function that converts a string ```s``` to the NULL-terminated array of words and frees all unused memory.

```mx_strjoin ``` - Create a function concatenates strings s1 and s2 into new string and terminates new string with ``` '\0' ``` .

```mx_file_to_str ``` - Function takes a filename as a parameter and then reads the data from file into the string.

```mx_read_line ``` - Reads the line from the given ```fd``` into the ```lineptr```.

```mx_replace_substr ``` - Function that replaces all occurrences of ``` sub``` in ```str``` with ```eplace``` .

## [Memory pack](memory_pack)
